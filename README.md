##Predict whether a flight will be delayed based on features like DepDelay, CarrierDelay, and WeatherDelay.

Tools/Platforms:
Tools: Python libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning.
Platform: Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Load and Preprocess the Dataset:
Select features like DepDelay, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, etc.
Create a target variable (1 for delayed flights, 0 for on-time flights).
Split Data:
Use Scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Model:
Train a Random Forest Classifier to predict delays.
Evaluate the Model:
Calculate accuracy and generate a classification report.

Output:
Model performance metrics, such as accuracy and classification report.
Example Output:
Metric	Value
Accuracy	89.5%
Precision	90.2%
Recall	88.7%
